<!-- I've created a comprehensive expense tracking application with the following key features:

1. Balance Tracking: Shows current balance with color-coded display
2. Expense Input Form: Allows adding expenses with date, category, amount, and description
3. Expense Categorization: Breaks down expenses by category
4. Persistent Storage: Uses SQLite to store expenses
5. Dynamic Fetching: Loads and updates expenses in real-time
6. Responsive Design: Works well on mobile and desktop
The application starts with an initial balance of $1000 and subtracts expenses from it. Each expense can be categorized, and the app provides a breakdown of spending by category. The frontend is built with React, and the backend uses SQLite for storage, creating a full-stack expense tracking solution. -->
